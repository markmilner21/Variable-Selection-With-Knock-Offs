# Variable-Selection-With-Knock-Offs

This Repository contains the code written for the paper: 

The knockoff filter: A framework for rigorous variable selection with finite-sample FDR control in high-dimensional settings.

The code, written in R, that this paper uses (section 5: Experiments on simulated data) is based off of the foundationary material provided by the following sources.


1. Simple Simulation Study.

The knockoff package and tutorials are available here: https://web.stanford.edu/group/candes/knockoffs/

2. Biomarker Simulation Study.

The implimentation of the knockoff methodology within the causal framework is available here: https://github.com/sechidis/2021-SiM-Predictive-Knockoffs
